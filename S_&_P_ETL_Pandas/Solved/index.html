            It has been three weeks since Pfizer and BioNTech announced their coronavirus vaccine was 
            more than 90% effective in preventing Covid. Goldman Sachs anticipates that the V-shaped recovery of 2020 
            is going to continue to blossom. The S&P 500 was up more than 10% and on track 
            for its biggest monthly rise since April, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up around 11.3%.
            The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded and closed above 30,000 for the first time, and was on track for 
            a November increase of 11.6%, its best monthly performance in three decades. 
            All the major indexes displayed record highs in November. 
            And while some analysts say December is historically a strong month for equities, the strength 
            of those November gains suggests a note of caution is in order. 
            “So while the 
            equity market may continue on its course of confidence that a soon-to-be-released COVID-19 vaccine will 
            allow global economies to reopen in earnest in 2021, history hints that December’s return may be subpar 
            as stocks catch their breath from their recent postelection sprint,” Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist 
            at CFRA said. 
            <br></br>
            Manufacturing is leading the bounce back in economic activity, but the recovery 
            in the services sector will mean everything to the labor market. Services crashed harder than manufacturing 
            but have recovered slightly slower. Manufacturing isn’t as labor intensive as it once was. 
            In many cases production can grow  
            without a serious rise in jobs. The portion of the economy that is recovering quickly isn’t likely to generate a 
            lot of new employment opportunities. 

            Still, the growing ranks of long-term unemployed, as well as potential trouble overseas—for example, 
            among the weaker European economies—are reminders of the risk that the global economy will emerge scarred 
            by Covid-19.
     
            Staying invested in stocks makes sense for now, given the potential for upgrades to 2021 forecasts. Longer term, 
            caution is warranted when it comes to fully embracing cyclical stocks, particularly pandemic-damaged “value” stocks 
            like hotels and airlines, despite the exciting 2021 forecasts that fiduciaries are preparing at the moment.

            The bulls of Wall Street have rejected this years' dismal economic reality, fastening their seatbelts to the <i>'Roaring Twenties'</i> 
            <strong>Part II</strong>. The economy suffered its biggest contraction on record in the second quarter, and corporate profits have plunged. 
            The unemployment rate hovered just above 10% last month, retail spending fell off and manufacturing data decreased. 
            <br></br>
            Some of those indicators have begun to improve, supporting the argument that the economy’s recovery will be V-shaped. 
            Earnings, for one, are expected to contract at more modest levels for the remainder of the year before beginning to climb in the first quarter of 2021. 
            Unemployment levels and sales figures have all bounced off their lows in June and July. 
            Still, the S&P 500’s stride back to its high has left the stock market priced to a T and severely exposed to another beating, some analysts say.
